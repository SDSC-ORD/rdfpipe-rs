`rdfpipe-rs` is meant to replicate the command line interface of rdfpipe, a python-based command line tool bundled with [rdflib](https://github.com/RDFLib) that allows conversion between RDF exchange file formats (turtle, json-ld, rdf/xlm, ntriples, ...). The goal of `rdfpipe-rs` is to be a drop in replacement which provides better performance to handle larger files.
